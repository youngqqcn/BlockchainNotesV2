## Cosmos Hub

The Cosmos Hub (`gaia`) docs have moved [here](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/tree/master/docs).

## Languages

The Cosmos-SDK is currently written in [Golang](https://golang.org/), though the
framework could be implemented similarly in other languages.
Contact us for information about funding an implementation in another language.
